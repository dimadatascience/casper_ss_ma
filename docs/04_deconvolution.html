Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it
difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine.
Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>ConsensusTME</h1>
<p>To estimate the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune and stromal
cell populations from bulk RNA-seq data, we used the ConsensusTME R
package. ConsensusTME implements a consensus-based approach that
integrates multiple published immune deconvolution methods to provide
robust and comprehensive cell-type enrichment scores.</p>
<p>The consensus gene sets are applied within a single-sample gene set
enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) framework to compute normalized enrichment
scores (NES) for each cell type. These scores represent the relative
abundance of immune and stromal cell types across samples, not across
cell types within a sample.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these scores allow for comparisons
between samples, but not between different cell types in the same
sample. The Immune Score summarizes the overall immune infiltration
level for each sample and can be used to stratify tumors based on immune
context.</p>
<div id="samples" class="section level3">
<h3>Samples</h3>
<p>To investigate the relationship between TME content, CD82 gene
expression and aneuploidy levels, we stratified samples based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CD82 expression: Samples were divided into high-CD82 and low-CD82
groups using the median expression value of the gene CD82 across all the
conditions as the cutoff.</p></li>
<li><p>Aneuploidy score: Samples were categorized into high-aneuploidy
and low-aneuploidy groups using a fixed threshold of 0.1 on the
aneuploidy score (defined by looking at aneuploidy score distribution
across all the conditions)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="method-selection" class="section level3">
<h3>Method selection</h3>
<p>To estimate cell-type or pathway activity from bulk RNA-seq data, we
applied gene set scoring methods available in ConsensusTME, including
ssgsea, singScore, gsva, plage, and zscore.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ssGSEA (Single Sample GSEA)</em> calculates enrichment scores
per sample by integrating gene ranks across each gene set. It is robust
to noise and does not require normalized input.</li>
<li><em>singScore</em> is a rank-based, non-parametric method similar to
ssGSEA but simpler and faster.</li>
<li><em>GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis)</em> estimates gene set
enrichment as a continuous function of gene expression and is ideal for
normalized data such as TPM or VST.</li>
<li><em>PLAGE (Pathway Level Analysis of Gene Expression)</em> uses
principal component analysis (PCA) to summarize gene set activity,
assuming multivariate normality.</li>
<li><em>Z-score</em> computes the standardized average expression of
genes within each gene set.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the following analysis, we used GSVA method and provided TPM
counts matrix as input.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The output of the ConsensusTME analysis is a matrix of cell-type
scores, where each row represents a sample and each column corresponds
to an estimated abundance or activity of a specific immune or stromal
cell type. The following heatmap represents the results of the
analysis.</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
